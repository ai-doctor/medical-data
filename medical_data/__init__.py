__DementiaBank__
 
The English Pitt corpus from DementiaBank, a shared database developed in the MacWhinney lab at Carnegie Mellon University. This database includes spontaneous speech (re-telling of the Cinderella story) from 167 subjects diagnosed with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease and 97 healthy control subjects. All subjects were recorded as part of the multi-site multi-year Pittsburgh Alzheimer Research Center (PARC) with funded support from NIH-NIA to Charles F. Reynolds III and Judith Saxton, at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. This database uses the CHAT transcription format and the CLAN programs that accompany CHILDES.
